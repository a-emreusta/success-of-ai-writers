Datasets
=============================
SNLI (Standford Natural Language Inference) and ANLI (Adversarial Natural Language Inference) are datasets used to evaluate the performance of natural language processing models.

SNLI is a collection of 570k English language sentence pairs annotated with labels indicating whether the sentences are entailed, contradictory, or neutral with respect to each other. It is often used as a benchmark for evaluating the ability of machine learning models to perform natural language inference, which involves determining the relationship between two sentences.

ANLI is a newer dataset that was created to test the robustness of natural language processing models. It consists of 4.5 million sentence pairs and includes a variety of types of adversarial examples, such as sentences with grammatical errors or sentences that are intentionally misleading.

Both SNLI and ANLI are widely used in the field of natural language processing and are available for download from the internet.
